      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a fascinated guy who loves the universe and learning. I also loved develping this.</p>

      <h2>My Skills.</h2>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="merc" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3413/3413225.png" alt="Mercury Image">
        <h3 class="merch">Programming. First things first.</h3>
        <p>I am still a begginer to all of this, but I already loved everything and I've got a lot of friends who also loves and helps me anytime I need.
           It already became part of my life and I will keep it going as far as I can. If I loved developing this site, why wouldn't I love to get better and develop
           amazing things? Up to now I have learned HTML5, CSS and gone kind of deep into C# language.</p>
           <p>I will be learning how to program as fast and as good as Mercury does around the sun!</p>
           <p>Did you know Mercury it is not the hottest planet? It is though the smallest and fastest.</p>
      </div>

        <img class="ven" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/1086/1086139.png" alt="Venus Image">
        <h3 class="venh">Instruments.</h3>
        <p>Well, I still don't play instruments, yet I've got some practice in the guitar. Since then I realised how great is music, and loved it.
          I can't help but wait untill I
        start getting eletric-guitar classes, or maybe some bass, from that on, I will be posting my progression somewhere, and I'll link it here too.</p>
        <p>Someday I will be playing with fire in my fingers, just like Venus is(Not Literally, both cases).</p>
        <p>Venus is actually the hottest planet, due to its size, yet scientists might have found life in there, and I am here complaining about my city's wheather.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="ear" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/921/921490.png" alt="Earth Image">
        <h3 class="earh">The art is beautiful.</h3>
        <p>We all know at least a bit of what is art, we all have artistics sides in the end. Mine is writing, I loved it.
          It took too long for me to realise I could write the story I wanted to tell, it did less for me to be in love with the stories though.
          The thing is, I am practicing and writing, and someday I will be great at it. My "in progress" book is on my <a class="drive"href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1tYR25kT4fxCOLUi7e56zXslbP53VcMQp">drive</a>
          .</p>
          <p>Somewhen I will be writing as good as some people do around here.</p>
          <p>Everything in the universe is a mess for us, some places are too hot, others too cold, and all of it is chaotic. Furtunately the Earth is a perfect place to grow life.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="mars" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2530/2530892.png" alt="Mars Image">
        <h3 class="marsh">Yeah Mr. White! Yeah Science!</h3>
        <p>hope you get the Breaking Bad reference here. I really do love science. It was one of the really first topic I ever thought about studying really hard to
        learn more about, I even thought about working with it. My passion came from Physics, witch is amazing, part of the inspiration to this site's theme.
        When I learned a thing or two about how the universe works, I always would be amazed and wordless.</p>
        <p>A small planet with so much search on it, so much science! So much learning! So much to say.</p>
        <p>The red planet, as it is called. It is the only planet near us that we could set our feet on, without dying of course. Despite all the myths, it is a vastness, cold and lonely place. Look out for the sand storms.</p>
      </div>
      <p>As you can see, there are still four missing planets, I will get this work done soon enough, I promise.</p>
