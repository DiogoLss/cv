  <h3>I am a writer! Or maybe kind of one</h3>
  <p>I could say that I have always loved to read and write
    but that would be a lie, because I didn't. I started to read late, around fifteen years.
    It was when I found out the book "The Name of the Wind" by <a href="https://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/index.asp">Patrick Rothfuss.</a> Since then
    I liked stories, I know they are not true, but I love them. In 2020 I decided to write one myself and so I found out it wasn't easy as I thought. I could tell you a lot of things
    about it, but now I try to write my book and I post every chapter of it on my <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1tYR25kT4fxCOLUi7e56zXslbP53VcMQp">drive</a></p>
  <p>I'm far from being a good writer, but I hope you enjoy something of it, maybe you enjoy it too and maybe we could talk about the subject if you enjoy it too.</p>
